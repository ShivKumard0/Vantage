# Vantage - Intelligent Project Management Dashboard

[Vantage Dashboard](https://vantage-sigma.vercel.app/dashboard)

## 🎯 Objective

**Vantage** is designed to be the central nervous system for modern project management offices (PMOs). It moves beyond simple task tracking to provide a holistic view of project health, governance, and resource optimization. Our goal is to empower Project Managers with actionable intelligence, not just raw data.

## 🛑 The Problem (Pain Points)

Modern project management is often plagued by:

*   **Fragmented Data**: Critical information is scattered across emails, spreadsheets, and disparate tools (Jira, Asana, Excel), making it impossible to get a "single pane of glass" view.
*   **Reactive Firefighting**: PMs often find out about risks (budget overruns, delays) when it's too late to act, leading to project failure.
*   **Governance & Compliance Gaps**: Ensuring every project adheres to company standards (GDPR, Security, Budget) is a manual, error-prone process.
*   **Resource Burnout**: Lack of visibility into team workloads leads to uneven distribution, causing burnout for some and underutilization for others.

## ✅ The Solution

Vantage addresses these challenges directly:

1.  **Unified Command Center**: We aggregate data from multiple sources into a **single, real-time dashboard**. No more tab-switching or manual report generation.
2.  **Proactive AI Insights**: Instead of just showing what happened, Vantage uses **Predictive AI** to forecast budget burn and delivery confidence, alerting you *before* a risk becomes a crisis.
3.  **Automated Governance**: A dedicated **Governance Tracker** ensures every project passes critical stage gates (Security, Legal, Finance) before moving forward.
4.  **Visual Resource Management**: **Team Snapshots** provide instant visibility into who is overloaded and who has capacity, enabling data-driven resource balancing.
